    <h2 id="maincontent">What is Football?
        <p>Association football more commonly known as football or soccer, a sport played between 2 slides of 11 players with a spherical ball. Football is the worlds most popular sport. Outfield players move the ball with any part of the body except their hands or arms, whilst the ball is in play. Only the goal keeper can use their hands and this is only in their penalty area. When the ball goes out of play at either side of the pitch an opposing player from the side which did not put the ball out of play can throw the ball back into play using their hands. Both feet must remain on the floor behind the throw line. Both hands must remain on the ball until it is released from behind the throwers head. The object of football is to outscore your opponents. A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts. A draw is when both teams score the same amount of goals during the allotted time.
